title: "Book Review: The New Jim Crow"
---
[This book](https://newjimcrow.com/) discusses why **Mass Incarceration** is real, the legal systems that uphold it, and what systemic issues we need to address to not only dismantle mass incarceration, but ensure that we don't create another racial caste system.

Here are some takeaways from the book, but I do not do it justice. Michelle Alexander gives statistics, cites case law and other powerful antidotes to make her case. Since I listened to the audiobook, rather than read the ebook, it's a bit difficult to summarize her words, so I will be paraphrasing. This may not be entirely accurate, I did my best to fact check, but these are just my interpretations, not necessarily my opinions or facts.

### 1. Mass Incarceration is a racial caste system, locking up Black folks in prisons for non-violent crimes.

The system has several parts:

1. During the Civil Rights Movement, Black protestors fighting for everyone's rights were painted as criminals. Although it was firstly a conservative standpoint, it eventually became a bipartisan view that perpetuated into our culture. Just look at how "gangster" culture has perpetuated globally—even in Chinese media, I see the styles in music, clothing and speech.
2. With precedent that *allows racial bias*, police disproportionately go to poor neighbourhoods filled with POC (due to redlining) and arrest them for mostly non-violent crimes: possession/selling of marijuana, cocaine, etc. Usually they stalk neighbourhoods and use "traffic stops" (eg. not using a turn signal at the right time ... which I'm sure ALL of us have done) and forcing "consent" to search for drugs with dogs.
    - **[McCleskey v. Kemp](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1986/84-6811)**—racial bias in courts is legal unless there is explicit words of bigotry
    - **[United States v. Armstrong](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/95-157)**—while trying to get evidence to prove that whites were sent to State for lesser penalties than Blacks for crack, prosecutors denied giving evidence saying there must be a case that a white person should have gone to Federal rather than State
    - **[United States v. Brignoni-Ponce](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1974/74-114)**—Supreme court allowing race as a factor for police discretion (in this case, declaring Mexicans to be “aliens”)
    - **[Alexander v. Sandoval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_v._Sandoval)**—Private litigants can’t sue police departments for racial profiling. Only the federal government can. This case alone stopped all the charges of racial bias in the justice system.
    - **[100-to-1](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/us-supreme-court-weighs-100-1-disparity-crackpowder-cocaine-sentencing)**—same criminal sentencing for possession/selling of 1 gram of crack and possession/selling 100g of powder cocaine, even though they have the same effect
3. Plea bargains, little access to lawyers and peremptory strikes incentivize people to say that they're guilty, and have an all-white court by arbitrarily removing jurors: 
    - **[Peremptory strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peremptory_challenge)**—Allowing all white jurors: In addition to the fact that jurors are chosen through registered voters + DMV lists (Underrepresentation of POC ppl due to their less likelihood to vote and own cars), so long as language is race neutral, systemically barring black jurors is allowed. Too young/old, conservative/liberal, comfortable/uncomfortable, wearing hats/sunglasses, “lack of education, employment, poverty” (disproportionately POC are in these situations) etc.
    - **[Purkett v. Elem](https://www.lawpipe.com/U.S.-Supreme-Court/Purkett_v_Elem.html)**—“unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor's explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral”. In the case, a prosecutor had said he struck a black juror because he had long hair. “And I don’t like the way they look. The moustache and the beards don’t look good to me”.
4. The system doesn't care the amount of prison time you do, but having "felon" on your record prevents you from getting food stamps, public housing, voting rights, etc. **even after fulling serving your sentence for a crime**. Legal employment is next to impossible, since they ask for background checks. Staying at friends/family's place is difficult because there are laws allowing tenants to be kicked out if they are in contact with any criminal. Finally, there is shame that keeps criminals isolated from others. **So long as we treat criminals as subhuman, this system remains**.

### 2. Racial bribes have damaged everyone, by impeding societal progress.

Here are some examples of racial bribes that we've bought and are dangerous: 

- **Whiteness is superior to being black.** After [Bacon's Rebellion](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-2/inventing-black-and-white#:~:text=Many%20historians%20point%20to%20an,1676%20as%20a%20turning%20point.&text=Although%20Bacon%20died%20of%20fever,had%20destroyed%20the%20colonial%20capital.), where poor whites and blacks banded together to overturn plantation owners, the Virginia government *systematically* gave whites more rights than blacks because they were afraid of another rebellion. This was when "white" as a phrase was created. And ultimately, the concept of black/white was used to justify inhumane treatment of slaves. It's the illusion of address poor white folks' needs of respect, through pushing down minorities, rather than *giving quality jobs and education that they need*.
- **Affirmative action will lead to equity**. This concept really messed me up because I personally benefit from affirmative action as an Asian woman. The justification for this concept was that it's a bandage—we're currently scared that without affirmative action, there would be no access for minorities into positions of power. But with this illusion, we don't actually *address underlying barriers* on why there is such little access (it's economic stability, access to quality education, toxic cultures, etc.). Additionally, some are *reluctant to criticize* folks who are minorities for these broken structures, for fear that they seem discriminatory. It's the illusion of progress without real progress.
- **Colourblindness is the goal**. By ignoring race in conversations and all differences, we ignore *all of the unconcious bias* that we have. Instead of addressing how broken our systems are, we'll end up pretending that race "no longer matters". Instead of being colourblind, we must intentionally educate ourselves about race and have dialogues on how to create equity.

### 3. Economic change and restructuring will lessen the power of racism.

After the civil rights movement, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. campaigned for the [Poor People's Campaign](https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/about/). Although poor white folks have similar issues for access to health care, job loss, as poor black folks, they have been pitted against one another. Since rich folks can lobby for the government and have political power, the government is biased towards them. The website itself can better summarize the demands that I can, so I've linked that above.

I don't hold the views in or interpretations of the book very strongly, so I'm open to a dialogue. 

Overall, I now know that I, as a Chinese-Canada young woman, have my privileges. No police officer will see me as a threat, if anything, I potentially can get away with more crimes which is unfair. I used to think that so long as I wasn't Caucasian, I couldn't be racist. **Racism isn't just overt bigotry. It's systems that have the effect of treating races differently.**

The next book I plan to read is "How to be an Anti-Racist". Here's a book list that I'm roughly following [to learn more about racism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/antiracist-syllabus-governor-ralph-northam/582580/). Here's also a reading list I'm going through to [learn about racism, from an Asian female perspective](https://www.blackwomenradicals.com/blog-feed/black-and-asian-feminist-solidarities-a-reading-list).

This is a heavy topic, so thank you for reading my attempts to grapple with it. <3
