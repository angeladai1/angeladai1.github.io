title: "Book Review: Weapons of Math Destruction"
---
After I read "[AI superpowers](https://www.aisuperpowers.com/)", I randomly came across this book on my [Kobo Clara HD](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-hd?variant=12108077629510) e-reader. So thanks to that algorithm, here we are.

[This book](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/) talks about the dangers of overly trusting big data and machine learning to make decisions for us because of the self-fulfilling dangerous cycles it can create when placed in certain contexts. For example, recidivism and predicting if someone might reoffend based on "data" would be biased towards false positives for black folks.

I think the author does a good job on explaining the various scenarios that machine learning can wreak havoc and the consequences that happen. Whether it's firing teachers based on arbitrary measurements or too many companies using estimations of credit scores (based on our internet history) to target ads. She gives enough information for non-technical users to understand why the machines aren't perfect, without overloading readers with technical jargon.

I am biased in thinking that her arguments are strong because I picked up her book believing in the things she would write about. I read this after I watched her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cathy_o_neil_the_era_of_blind_faith_in_big_data_must_end?language=en), which really sold the ideas in the book to me.

Based on this book and also some other researching, I've become interested in [Machine Learning Fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning)#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20a%20given,sexual%20orientation%2C%20etc.).). Midway through reading her book, I started researching [technical talks](https://fairmlbook.org/tutorial1.html) and technical approaches in this field, so I did start losing interest. But if I do end up doing post-grad studies in this field, this book is the reason.

Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone for an eye-opening read. :)
