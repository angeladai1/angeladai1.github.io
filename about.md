### Background

I was born in Guangzhou, China and immigrated to Canada with my family when I was 4. I went to 7 different schools during my K-12 years in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. I now go to UBC and am studying [Business and Computer Science](https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/program-requirements/combined-major-in%C2%A0business-and-computer-science). I will be graduating in May 2021!

### Hobbies

- **Reading**: Growing up, I always got in trouble with my mom because I stayed up reading. Recently, I bought a [Kobo Clara HD](https://www.amazon.ca/Kobo-Clara-6IN-EPD-Carta/dp/B07CXNMVKY) when the libraries closed due to COVID-19, and I've gotten back into reading! I've mostly been reading non-fiction books in these genres: business, autobiographies, self-help and philosophy. But I'm open to new suggestionsâ€”send me a book recommendation!
- **Sewing**: I'm fortunate that my boyfriend's family lent me a sewing machine because I have been sewing up a storm! I like to make clothes and accessories out of old clothes or clothes I find at the thrift store. Not only is this good for the environment, but I also get to think creatively while making clothes.
- **Yoga + Pilates**: After my car accident, I've relied on my daily yoga and pilates practices to keep my body strong and flexible. I follow [Blogilates](https://www.blogilates.com/calendar/) and [Yoga with Adriene](https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/) for free workouts :).
